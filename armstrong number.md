Armstrong Number
An Armstrong number is a positive m-digit number that is equal to the sum of the mth powers of their digits. It is also known as pluperfect, or Plus Perfect, or Narcissistic number. It is an OEIS sequence A005188. Let’s understand it through an example.

Armstrong Number Example
1: 11 = 1

2: 21 = 2
3: 31 = 3

153: 13 + 53 + 33 = 1 + 125+ 27 = 153

125: 13 + 23 + 53 = 1 + 8 + 125 = 134 (Not an Armstrong Number)

1634: 14 + 64 + 34 + 44 = 1 + 1296 + 81 + 256 = 1643

Similarly, we can check other number also.
